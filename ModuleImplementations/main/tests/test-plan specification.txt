Test-plan
==========

testbench is a c-shell driver script to test the random password generator.

The script requires three sub-directories in the directory it is located.
tinp  --> this is the location for the input parameters.
texp  --> this is the location for the expected output when rndpassword
          is executed.
tact  --> this is the location for the actual output when rndpassword was
          executed.
          
For each file located in tinp, testbench will execute rndpassword and pass
the contents of the file to rndpassword as command line parameters.  A test
counter will be incremented for every test run.

The output of rndpassword will then be redirected to the tact directory, 
using the same filename as the file from the tinp directory.

Diff will then be run on the newly created file in tact and a file in the 
texp directory with the same name.  If there are any differences, the error
count will be incremented, indicating the mismatch.  The actual output 
from diff is not saved, but redirected to /dev/null.

When all the files in tinp have be processed, the script will output a 
summary indicating the number of tests run and the number of errors
encountered.

The program will then terminate.
