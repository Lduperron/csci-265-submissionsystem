CS1 Testbench MIS


Normal behaviour
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Interface:
This program will be called via the command line, and wil be provided with the following parameters:
 - argument 1 = <COURSENAME>
 - argument 2 = <ASSIGNMENTNAME>
 - argument 3 = <STUDENTNAME>
 
Copy a makefile from courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/makefile to courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/makefile.
It then executes courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/makefile to create the necessary executable file.

Executes courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>
 with command line arguments specified in multiple test files stored in courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/tinp/.
The output will be directed to courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/tact/ using the same file name as the file in courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/tinp/.
A diff will then be run to compare that output with the lecturer provided expected files in courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/texp/.

This will produce a courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/errors.txt with the output from diff and 
a courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/summary.txt containing the total number of test cases and the total number of test cases that failed.


Assumptions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
   No interactive testing is supported.
   All referenced files exist and have proper format.
   all makefiles will maintain absolute references to all files.
