CS2 Testbench MIS
==================
IMPORTANT:  All changes in current working directory.  Multiple commands should be separated by semicolons.  Successive line (after a new line character) will revert back to the current working directory of the parent process or system call, i.e. bin.

Normal behaviour
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Interface:

   This program will be called via the command line, and will be provided the following prarameters:

   - argument 1 = <COURSENAME>
   - argument 2 = <ASSIGNMENTNAME>
   - argument 3 = <STUDENTNAME>

Copy the makefile from courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/makefile to courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/makefile.
Execute courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/makefile to create the necessary executable file.

The output will be directed to courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/tact/ using the same file name as the file in courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/tinp/.
A diff will then be run to compare that output with the lecturer provided expected files in courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/texp/.

This will produce a courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/errors.txt with the output from diff and
a courses/<COURSENAME>/<ASSIGNMENTNAME>/<STUDENTNAME>/summary.txt containing the total number of test cases and the total number of test cases that failed.


Assumptions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
   No interactive testing is supported
   All referenced files exist and have proper format.
   All makefiles will maintain absolute referances to all files.
