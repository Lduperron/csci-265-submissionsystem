Passmod MIS
==================

Normal behaviour
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The passgen and verification module (named Passmod.pm, for PASSword MODule) will handle password generation and password authentication.  
Takes a username from another module and generates a list of passwords
Tke a username and a password and return true or false if it is a valid username / password pair.  As soon as a password is returned ‘true’ it is invalidated.    The module has defaults that will be printed to the screen in a subroutine and will also provide methods to edit these defaults for the session, such as number of passwords or password complexity.

Settings:
	length (int)
	type (string, alphanum or num)
	number (number of passwords in a password sheet)
	
Defaults:
   Directory Path:  ../../students/
   Length:  8
   Type:    num
   Number:  20
   
Public methods:
-	generate(name) – Attempts to create a file with the name '<name>passwordSheet.txt' inside of the ../../students directory with a list of one-time passwords.  Immediately invalidates any existing passwords for the provided name if a password file already exists.
-	verify(name, password) – Returns true or false, checking against the top password in the file with the name “name”.  If true, password is immediately invalidated and deleted from the file.  
-	printSettings() – Prints current password generation settings to standard out
-	getSetting(setting) - Returns a string containing the value of the associated setting.
-	setSetting(setting, value) – Modifies a setting to a new value.  Preforms no checking on provided value.
