Submit Server Interface Specification

This module receives and processes assignment submissions from students. 

This program will receive a course number, user id, password, and 
assignment name from a client via socket connection. It will pass the 
user name & password to the password verifier module to be checked. It 
will then check that user’s enrollment in the course. Next it will 
verify the assignment name matches one of the course’s assignments. 
Finally it will check that the server’s current date & time is before
the assignment’s due date. If any of these checks fail, the server will 
print out an error and close the connection with the client. Otherwise, 
it will now send the client the all-clear, and wait for the assignment. 
Once the assignment is received, it will store it in that user’s 
instance inside the assignment directory. The server then closes the 
socket and waits for next client connection.
