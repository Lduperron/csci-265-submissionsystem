Submit Server Interface Specification

This module receives and processes assignment submissions from students. 

This program will receive a user id, password, course number and 
assignment name from a client via socket connection. First it will go 
into the student directory to check that user's enrollment. It will pass the 
user name & password to the password verifier module to be checked. It 
will then check that user’s enrollment in the course. Next it will 
verify the assignment name matches one of the course’s assignments. 
Finally it will check that the server’s current date & time is before
the assignment’s due date. If any of these checks fail the server will 
send an error to the client, and close the connection. Otherwise, it 
will now send the client the all-clear, and wait for the assignment. 
Once the assignment is received, it will store it in that user’s 
instance inside the assignment directory. It will pass back to the 
client whether or not this was succesful. The server then closes the 
socket and waits for next client connection.
