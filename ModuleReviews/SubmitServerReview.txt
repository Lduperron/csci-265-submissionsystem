ML    Comment on why "Find::Bin" was used
         -in case program called from another directory, finds program's
          location)
   
ML    Why does the for loop (line45) go from 0 to 4?
         -to prevent deadlocks between userClient & submitServer 
          encountered during development
         -could be removed and restructured, but due to time restraints
          it will be kept
         -Loop doesn't go through 4 times, only 3. Change 4 to 3.
      
      Group acknowledges main issue here is that there were no working
      MIS's for SubmitServer and UserClient before programming began, so
      their communication was not defined.
         
LD    Errors should be defined at beginning and commented when used

OL    Comment file transmission

LD    We assume its an ascii file not a compiled program

OL    isEnrolled & validAsgmn have lots of redundancy between them
         -Due to time restraints, leave as is
         
ML    dateTime needs comment explanation

      Needs more comments in general
