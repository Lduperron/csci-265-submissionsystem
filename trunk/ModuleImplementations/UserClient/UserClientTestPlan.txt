Test plan
===============================================================================

testbench is a c shell script designed to test the ability of UserClient.pl 
(named submit after run through makefile) to handle correct user input, failed
server connections, failed file opens, file input, and codes sent back from 
server.

This script has 6 subdirectories in the directory it is in:
tinp --> the location of the input parameters for the test cases that use 
         stub.pl (named stub after run through makefile) as the server
tinp2 --> the location of the input parameters for the test cases that do not 
	      use stub.pl as the server
texp --> the expected values for the test cases using stub.pl as the server
texp2 --> the expected values for the test cases not using stub.pl as the 
          server
tact --> the location of the output generated by the test cases using stub.pl
          as the server
tact2 --> the location of the output generated by te test cases not using 
          stub.pl as the server

testbench begins testing by turning the server stub.pl on.
For each file in tinp testbench will increment $test_count, execute the 
parameters given by the tinp file in question in UserClient.pl (named submit 
after run through makefile), output the results into a correspondingly named 
file in the tact directory, diff the respective tact and texp files and, if the
diff finds any differences in the two files, increment $error_count and output 
an error message (with test number failed). 

testbench then kills the server stub.pl and increments $test_count.  It then 
runs the parameters given by tinp2/11, outputs the result into a correspondingly 
named tact2 file, diffs the respective tact2 and texp2 files and, if diff finds 
any differences between the two files, increments $error_count and outputs
an error mesage (with the test number failed).

testbench then turns on the server stub2.pl (named stub2 after run through 
makefile). It then runs the parameters given by tinp2/12, outputs the result 
into a correspondingly named tact2 file, diffs the respective tact2 and texp2 
files and, if diff finds any differences between the two files, increments 
$error_count and outputs an error mesage (with the test number failed).

testbench then kills stub2.pl and outputs a message saying how many tests were
run and with how many errors.

The program then terminates.
