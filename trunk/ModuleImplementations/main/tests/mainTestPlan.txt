Test-plan
==========

testbench is a perl driver script to test the adminClient of the Submission system.

The script requires three sub-directories in the directory it is located.
tinp  --> this is the location for the input parameters.
texp  --> this is the location for the expected output.
tact  --> this is the location for the actual output.
          
For each file located in tinp, testbench will execute adminClient and pass
the contents of the file to adminClient as keystroke input.  A test
counter will be incremented for every test run.

The output of adminClient will then be redirected to the tact directory, 
using the same filename as the file from the tinp directory.

Diff will then be run on the newly created file in tact and a file in the 
texp directory with the same name.  If there are any differences, the error
count will be incremented, indicating the mismatch.  The actual output 
from diff is not saved, but redirected to /dev/null.

When all the files in tinp have be processed, the script will output a 
summary indicating the number of tests run and the number of errors
encountered.

The program will then terminate.

test0 - tests starting & stopping Submit Server
test1 - tests starting, when the server is started, and stopping, 
		when the server it stopped. It also tests various permutations
		of capitals and smalls.
test2 - tests generating and clearing passwords for all and a single user.
		sends incorrect and correct information to single user tests to 
		verify error handling.
test3 - tests calling password generation and clearing repeatedly
test4 - tests calling of reporting module
test5 - tests help command
