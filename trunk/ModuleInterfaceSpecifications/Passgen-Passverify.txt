Module Interface - Passgen / Passverify

The passgen and verification module will handle password generation and password authentication.  The module will have limited user and disk I/O.   Standard operation is it takes a username from another module and generates a list of passwords, and can take a username and a password and return true or false if it is a valid username / password pair.  To be decided if it also takes a class and ties that username/password to that class.  As soon as a password is returned ‘true’ it is invalidated.    The module has defaults that will be printed to the screen in a subroutine and will also provide methods to edit these defaults for the session, such as number of passwords or password complexity.  To be decided if the module has the ability to read in a list of usernames from a file, or if another module would be responsible for that and passing the names to passgen one after another.  The module will maintain its own directory structure containing the users and passwords it has created.   
Public methods:
-	Generate(name , [class])  (Or maybe Generate(filehandle)) – Produces a file in its directory with a list of one-time passwords.  Immediately invalidates any existing passwords for the provided name (if in the same class)
-	Verify(name, password, [class]) – Returns true or false, checking against the top password in the file with the name “name”.  If true, password is immediately invalidated and deleted from the file.  
-	printSettings() – Prints current password generation settings to standard out
-	getSetting(setting) - Returns a string containing the value of the associated setting.
-	setSetting(setting, value) – Modifies a setting to a new value.  Preforms basic checking on provided value.

Settings:
	length (int)
	type (string, alphanum or num)
	number (number of passwords in a password sheet)
