Submit Server Interface Specification

This module receives and processes assignment submissions from students. 

This program will receive a user name, password and course number from a client.
It will then check that user’s enrollment in the course. Next, it will pass the user name & password to the password verifier module to be checked.

If it was successfully verified the program will confirm this to the client and wait for the assignment file.

If it failed the password verification, the client may submit a second password to be checked before the server closes the connection.

After receiving the file, the program will verify that it was submitted before the assignment’s due date.
If so, the server will store the submitted file in the user’s student file.
If either of the tests (enrollment, due date) fail, or the submission is unsuccessful, it will indicate that failure to the client and close the connection.
Otherwise, return to client that submission was successful.
The server will then close the connection with client and wait for next submission.
