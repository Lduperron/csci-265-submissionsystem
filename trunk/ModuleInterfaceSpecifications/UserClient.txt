Normal Behaviour
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This program will connect to a server.  It will then accept command line 
arguments.  This is the only way in which to input data into this program.  
These command line arguments, of which there 
must be 4, must be provided in the following order: 
    1) User name

    2) Password

    3) Name of class to submit project to

    4) Filename

If one or more of the aforementioned are not included an appropriate error 
message saying such will be output and the program will exit with a value of 1.
If too many command line arguments are provided a message saying so will be 
output and the program will exit with a value of 1.  

The program then passes name, password, and class name to the server.
If the user name/password combination or class name are invalid or the 
assignment is late the server passes an error code prompting this program 
(UserClient.pl) to output a message saying so and exit with a value of 1.    

If the program has not exited in the step above it sends the filename provided
by the user to the server.  If the server deems the filename to be invalid it 
passes an appropriate error code to this program (UserClient.pl) leading this
program to output an appropriate error message and exit with a value of 1. 

The program then sends the number of lines in the file and the file to the 
server.

If the program was able to successfully submit the file provided by the user
a success message saying so is output and the program exits.  If the program was
unsuccesful in submitting the file provided by the user an appropriate error
message is output and the program exits. 

Exceptions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Unable to connect to server: an appropriate error message is output and the
program exits.

File provided is unable to be opened: an appropriate error message is output and
the program exits.

Assumptions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Somewhere a server with appropriate programming is waiting for UserClient to
connect to it (i.e. a server with modules capable of handling the information
passed to it by UserClient)

The server will pass back information which can be interpreted by UserClient
(e.g. the server will pass back between one and three of "1", "2", "3", "4", 
"5", "400")

The file being submitted to UserClient exists and can be opened by UserClient

The user is able to enter input into the command line (e.g. perl UserClient.pl
username password classname filename)

The user has PERL installed on their computer 

The user has the CPAN library IO::Socket installed on their computer 

The user is running debian LINUX on their computer

The user has a copy of this program
