ML    What is function of "open(INFILE, @ARGV)"?
         -Found it unnecessary, remove

OJ    Uses exit(0) when closing due to an error
         -switch error exits to exit(1), system expects that a exit(0)
          was good

ML    ARGV checks are overly complicated
         -if time allows, possibly just check for correct number of argv
          elements, otherwise print out an example of a correct program
          call (perl UserClient.pl <user> <password> <course> <file>)

OJ    At storing the file in the array, explicitly comment why loop
      starts at 3.

ML    Attach specific error checks to corresponding point in program
      where those errors would be recieved
         -invalid user/passw and invalid class after sending 
          user:password:course
         -invalid asgm after sending assignment name
         -Keep file submission success/failure check where it is after
          sending the file.

      More commenting in general
